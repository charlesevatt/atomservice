Atom Service is an open source, multipurpose pipeline and workflow service for Linux.

Atom Service can repeatedly run any scripts or programs whose actions can be triggered by system, file system or database changes.

Atom Service is designed for usage in automated, service-orientated systems.

Atom Service can be installed on single or multiple hosts depending on the requirement and workload.

Atom Service was designed to be used instead of CRON where regular execution of processes is essential, and where it may not be possible to predict how long a process will take, or how frequently a process might actually need to be called.
